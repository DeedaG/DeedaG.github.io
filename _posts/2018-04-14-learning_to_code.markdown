Well, I have been at this course for almost a month now, and I have a better understanding of coding.  I am also overwhelmed sometimes.  I enjoy the challenge of completing the labs and am getting used to the thrill of passing all of the tests and moving on to another lab.  I am concerned sometimes that I pass the tests without completely understanding the material because I have to rewrite some of the methods so many times.  I am going back and reviewing when I get stuck, and I have also learned that I need to ask questons all of the time.  

I got really stuck on Object Oriented TicTacToe and after spending about an hour with an ask a question coach my concerns about passing tests without completely understanding the material were realized.  I had to rewrite almost all of the methods so that they could work together.  I had changed some of my methods through the labs so that they would pass the tests.  I was concerned that they weren't all going to work together and I was correct.  However, I have noticed that I end up learning the most when I get stuck.  I spend so much time searching for answers that I see a bigger picture and I can apply it to the labs in a way that makes more sense to me. Live and learn.

I worked through most of the free coding introduction course before beginning this part of the course.  I have appreciated my exposure to that little bit of introduction because it has helped me understand the HTML and CSS introduction that I just finished . When I start feeling overwhelmed I try to take a break and I usually find that I come back with a clearer plan to clear the errors in the labs.

I am only working at this on a part time basis, so I am not moving through the lessons very quickly.  I am becoming addicted to it, though, and I plan to increase my time spent on the course in the next month.  I am hopeful that all of this work leads to something worthwhile.  Fingers crossed.
