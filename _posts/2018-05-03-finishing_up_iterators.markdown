The is my third blog.  I have been plugging along pretty well, but I had to care for a family member for a few days.  The surgery went well and I am getting back to my lessons and labs.  I am finishing up the section on iterators.  I find that I understand the lessons well, but sometimes have trouble putting the ideas into code on my own.  I met with my learn coach and she showed me a list of study groups that have been recorded.  I was able to go back and watch some specific study sessions that I was unable to attend.  They helped me get a better understanding of some points that I got stuck on during labs.  

I have also run into some bugs while writing my code during labs.  I followed some instructions through ask a question and the help center.  I don't know if these are completely fixed, but I will just go back to ask a question for help if I need it.  

I hope to pick up some speed after being preoccupied for a few days.  I still get stuck on syntax errors and sometimes understanding what the errors mean.  I feel that I get some crazy errors at times, but also feel that I am learning a lot through the messy ones.  I have to search long and deep to figure out the cause.  The searching always comes in handy the farther I get into this course.

One last point, I seem to do best when I keep a steady pace.  It is harder to get started if I take some time away.  Sometimes, this cannot be helped, but I always get pulled back in once I finally start a new lesson or even writing this blog.  The class is set up pretty well, as it keeps you motivated through the coaching and blogging.  I need to start considering what in the world I will do for a project that is coming up at some point and also to reach out to other students in the course.

Happy coding!
