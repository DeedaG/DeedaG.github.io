Well, I'm still working in Ruby.  

I'm trying to remember how to fit writers, readers, instance and class variables together in a way that works.  I am so excited when methods work.  I still get stuck on tiny mistakes that break the code, but I am thankful that I understand what breaking code means.  I am still working on this course on a part time basis and I am probably off schedule, but I am continuing.  

The pieces that normally trip me up happen when I am asked to rely on the tests and error messages.  Sometimes, they arent as clear to me as the labs that spell out the assignment. However, I have still learned a good bit about Object Orientation.  

I have learned that when a class has a name, for example, all you have to do is add name in attr_accessor, and that attr_reader prevents instance variables from being changed even though new instances are intitalized with them.  I have learned that shoveling in "self to a class variable will allow the ability to "keep track" of the created instances.  I've learned that adding a variable to initialize in the position of an argument, requires it to be specified each time a new instance is created.  I've learned that I can add new instances to a hash with a shovel method, when there is an array nested inside.  I have also become more comfortable iterating through an array with different methods and actually understanding what is going on.  I can use them to search and make changes.  I have also learned that there are many different ways of passing tests.  I can look for method names in the tests and then follow the test suite with "learn" to figure out what the methods are supposed to do.

Although I still get stuck a lot, I am feeling a tiny bit more confident each day.  I am always relieved when we cover the material more than once.  I can use these opportunities to practice what I am learning.  It is almost always an issue of syntax for me.  

Plugging forward...
