I am almost finished with my rails project.  I have studied the videos on has many belongs to through many many times.  I have googled "how to" in "rails" many many times, and I have read stack overflow until my eyes are getting tired and decided to enlarge the font size.  I even had an eye appointment and decided to add a special tint to my eyeglasses for blue light protection.  BUT, I figured out how to make this project run!

It feels great when the model on my join table actually allows methods that can succesfully be called on my other two models, and I can set up controllers that actually redirect to the correct views and include the necessary fields.  I am also able to change, add to, or delete columns in tables, as well as set up a scope method that actually filters and displays the correct information in my users' view.  I can inspect parameters and use the information to grab data in the right way to then call methods and create intelligent views.  I can set up check boxes and collection boxes with information supplied by a user and then can manipulate it to make useful  lists.  I used password digest for protection of users passwords and then used an admin method to provide information that is only accessible to admins of the application.  

I made use of forms for creating new users and new instances of models and finally also added a smart image from an outside url as the opening page of the application.  I added links to log in, sign in, see lists, and log out.  I only have to set up a 3rd party login service, test out editing and updating routes, as well as making a walk through video.  Hooray!  I am sure there is refactoring that I can do, but it works like it should, so I am very proud that the hardest part is complete.
