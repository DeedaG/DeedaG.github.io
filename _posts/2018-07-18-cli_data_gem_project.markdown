Well, I have started this project.  I had to change my plan a few times before I could start.  The walk through video helped me to see that my initial ideas for a project were too complicated to make work.  I decided to go with a simple idea, that basically follows the walk through video with a few different tweaks and, of course, different websites to scrape.  Once I really got into it, it wasn't quite as scary.  Setting up a gem was no big deal, but I spent a good bit of time getting my files to work with each other.  I learned a lot about require relative and bin folders as well as how to "run" files from different folders.  I never really understood how all of that worked until this project.  It is important to be sure to cd into a specific folder in order to run a file.  I guess I never really understood how it was organized. 

I also have taken a little break so that I could start at the same place as my fellow students in the more structured online beta program that I will be a part of for the next two months.  I didn't completely know what to expect, so I wanted to wait until I heard from the first group session and got more information.  I also felt a bit overwhelmed about starting the gem project and thought it would be great to be involved in a more structured plan to begin.  However, I started it the night before the first meeting for the beta project,  and after i set up my gem, it wasn't nearly so scary.  The gem comes with a clear template to work with and it looks just like the set up I see in the other labs I've been studying.  I also wasn't sure about committing to github because it is set up automatically in the labs, and all of these pieces seemed a bit overwhelming.  Anyway, I know more about this stuff than I sometimes realize because working with github has been no big deal at all.  I am still not finished with the project, but I am not afraid to tackle the second half of it.  I still need to set up my scraping and then read the rest of the lab to make sure that I have covered all of the assignment.  Even if the gem project doesn't go well, I am freshly motivated to move forward.
