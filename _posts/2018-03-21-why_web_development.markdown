My name is Christia and I am constantly trying new things.  I was never happy with my first degree in college because I didn't know what I wanted to do when I grew up.  I never really figured it out, but I worked in my field for many years.  
 
Eventually my first priority became my family.  They have needed me for longer than I expected.  I saw a piece on television about Flatiron School being a great vehicle for people to adapt to work in a modern economy.  While my previous positions have been very structured, web development allows creativity and flexibility.  I love to learn, I am very creative, and I want to update my skill set.  Lastly, I enjoy creating things and web development is exactly that.  I am hoping that this new skill will make me a more marketable job candidate.
