I missed this blog assignment somehow.  I realize I need to add these to my calendar.  

I have decided that I am using this blog as a record of my efforts in this course.  I should probably make sure this is what this blog is for, but for now, I will just keep recording my thoughts.  

I am working on the object oriented ruby section of the course and I am even feeling confident enough to use those words and sort of know what they mean.  I am trying to review sections when I don't remember them and still need help with syntax.  I often feel that I understand which ideas to put together but I don't always put them together correctly.  When I can't get labs to pass, I am usually so close to the correct order that I see that I need to really pay closer attention when reading through these lessons.  I understand the concepts and I am going to focus more on retaining the details.  I have spent more time reviewing and studying and this has also slowed me down.  Again, I am experimenting with this whole course.

The current material makes perfect sense to me and I hope that I will someday be able to effortlessly come up with code that runs and actually does what I intend it to do.  The gap between reading new material and application is frustrating.  I am still unable to complete all of these labs without any help, so I am just calling this the learning process and plugging forward.  I am always intending to increase my pace, but it hasn't happened yet.  I have a lot of other things on my plate at the moment, so I am taking this day by day.
